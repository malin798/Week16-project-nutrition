# Project Nutrition

This project was the last in the React and Redux sprint. The assignment  was to create an app which used the webcam to scan products and to fetch information about the product from the open food facts API.

## The problem

The biggest issue with the project was that the data was so inconsistent so we spent a lot of time on planning how to best retrieve and present the information. We solved it by deconstructing the data and make new variables and join them together in new constellations.
